## Expectations

We will work through the Stats in Sports course by Mike Lopez at Skidmore
College.  Once we get a sufficient amount of R base knowledge, we can start
working on the Draftkings problem.  To get credit in the course, you must:

* Read the assigned articles and discuss with Ryan.
* Complete the homework assignments.
* Write a end-of-class report.
