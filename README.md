# Statistical Methods in Sports

This is an independent study at the University of Denver.  I am borrowing 
liberally (with consent) from the
[course](https://statsbylopez.com/stats-sports-class/) taught by 
[Mike Lopez](https://statsbylopez.com/) at Skidmore College.  Mike's original github page for his course can be found
