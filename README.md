# Statistical Methods in Sports

This is an independent study at the University of Denver.  I am borrowing 
liberally (with consent) from the
[course](https://statsbylopez.com/stats-sports-class/) taught by 
[Mike Lopez](https://statsbylopez.com/) at Skidmore College.  Mike's original github page for his course can be found
[here](https://github.com/statsbylopez/StatsSports). 

We will use the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) 
book as our main reference.  

Any and all errors on this site can solely be attributed to Ryan Elmore.
Praise for the content can be directed Mike's way.
