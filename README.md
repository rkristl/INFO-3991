# Statistical Methods in Sports

This is an independent study at the University of Denver.  I am borrowing 
liberally (with consent) from the
[course](https://statsbylopez.com/stats-sports-class/) taught by 
[Mike Lopez](https://statsbylopez.com/) at Skidmore College.  Mike's original github page for his course can be found
[here](https://github.com/statsbylopez/StatsSports). 

We will use the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) 
book as our main reference.  

[Here is a link](https://github.com/rtelmore/sports-stats/wiki/Statistical-Methods-in-Sports) to the course wiki page. It contains links to reading material, lectures from Mike, etc. 

Any and all errors on this site can solely be attributed to Ryan Elmore.
Praise for the content can be directed Mike's way.
